# Overview
In this course, you will learn to identify common methodological issues encountered in quantitative comparative research and to address them using computational techniques.  Topics covered include data wrangling, exploration, and analysis (i.e., `data science'); Bayesian estimation of latent variables such as democracy, judicial independence, and respect for human rights across countries and over time; and computational approaches to the study to the dynamics of public opinion both within and across countries. This course is cross-listed in Comparative Politics and Methodology; it may be used to meet requirements in either subfield (but not both).

# Course Requirements
Your grade will be based on class participation (20%), assignments (10%), an exam (25%), a research presentation (20%), and a research paper (25%).  The following grades may be assigned at the end of the class: A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F.

## Class Participation
By this point in your career this should really go without saying, but here it is anyway: you can't learn in a class if you don't show up.  You should attend every meeting having completed the readings and assignments, that is, you should be ready to discuss use cases, ask good questions, and share any difficulties you've encountered.  

We will also be using [the Issues tab of a dedicated GitHub repository](https://github.com/cmcr-class/Discussion/issues) to continue our discussions outside of class. To start a new thread, create a new issue. If you want to be sure to get the attention of someone in particular, use their GitHub handle---mine is \texttt{@fsolt}---to tag them in your post: GitHub sends an email to people when they are tagged.

## Assignments
To practice your new skills, you will have regular assignments.  Some will be completed through GitHub in a private repository for each student (besides you, only I will have access to your homework repo). Others will be DataCamp short courses.  Others still will simply be readings that I want you to be sure to step through the embedded code.  All will be graded on a pass (that is, substantially completed)/fail basis.

## Exam
The exam will be available for your to take anytime after class on `r str_replace(meeting_headers[9], ".*, ", "")` until the start of class on `r str_replace(meeting_headers[11], ".*, ", "")`.  It will be open-note, open-interwebs---you know, just like [IRL](http://www.theallium.com/engineering/computer-programming-to-be-officially-renamed-googling-stackoverflow/).  Don't click the GitHub invitation link until you have three hours to spend completing the exam.

## Research Paper
The research paper for this course is more straightforward than the usual: the assignment is "simply" to write a fully reproducible version of a quantitative research paper you prepared for another class.  Ideally the paper will be for a class you are taking this semester, so that you use best practices as you go; you will need to confirm with the instructor of that course that this is acceptable to her or him.  Rewriting a promising paper from past coursework will also be fine, though.  If you're stuck for an appropriate paper, talk to me and we will work it out.

For your paper, you will:

- write using RMarkdown (or \texttt{knitr}) with interspersed \textsf{R} code and text,
- begin with raw data collection,
- include all steps of data cleaning and analysis,
- present figures rather than tables,
- use Bib\TeX for citations,
- automatically generate PDF, html, and (\raisebox{0.7ex}{ee}\raisebox{0.3ex}{e}w\raisebox{-0.3ex}{ww}\raisebox{-0.7ex}{w}!) Word versions,
- do your work in a GitHub repository,
- submit a link to that repo.

Papers are due the last day of exam week, Friday, May 10, before midnight. 

## Research Presentation
In our last class meeting, you will give a presentation based on your research paper to the class as if at an academic conference.  You will speak for 12 to 15 minutes.  You will have slides; these slides will not be filled with blocks of text.  You will use plots, not tables, to present results.  You will rock this.

# Further Course Information

### Administrative Home
The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (CLAS) is the administrative home of this course and governs its add/drop deadlines, the second-grade-only option, and other policies. These policies vary by college. See the [CLAS *Student Academic Handbook*](http://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook).

### Electronic Communication
Students are responsible for official correspondences sent to their UI email address (uiowa.edu) and must use this address for all communication within UI ([*Operations Manual*](http://www.uiowa.edu/~our/opmanual/iii/15.htm#152), III.15.2. Scroll down to k.11.)

### Accommodations for Disabilities
UI is committed to an educational experience that is accessible to all students. A student may request academic accommodations for a disability (such as mental health, attention, learning, vision, and physical or health-related condition) by registering with Student Disability Services (SDS). The student should then discuss accommodations with the course instructor. See <https://sds.studentlife.uiowa.edu/> for more information. 

### Nondiscrimination in the Classroom
UI is committed to making the classroom a respectful and inclusive space for all people irrespective of their gender, sexual, racial, religious or other identities. Toward this goal, students are invited to optionally share their preferred names and pronouns with their instructors and classmates. The University of Iowa prohibits discrimination and harassment against individuals on the basis of race, class, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, and other identity categories set forth in the University’s Human Rights policy. For more information, contact the Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity.  See <diversity.uiowa.edu> for more information.

### Academic Honesty
All CLAS students or students taking classes offered by CLAS have, in essence, agreed to the College's [Code of Academic Honesty](https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook/academic-fraud-honor-code). Misconduct is reported to the College, resulting in suspension or other sanctions, with sanctions communicated with the student through the UI email address See <https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook/academic-fraud-honor-code> for more information.

### CLAS Final Examination Policies
The final exam schedule for each semester is announced around the fifth week of classes; students are responsible for knowing the date, time, and place of a final exam. Students should not make travel plans until knowing this final exam information. No exams of any kind are allowed the week before finals.  See <https://clas.uiowa.edu/faculty/teaching-policies-resources-examination-policies> for more information.

### Making a Complaint
Students with a suggestion or complaint should first visit the instructor, [Professor Solt](mailto:frederick-solt@uiowa.edu), and then the departmental DEO, [Dr. Brian Lai](mailto:brian-lai@uiowa.edu) (Office: 343 SH). Students may then bring the concern to CLAS See <https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook/student-rights-responsibilities> for more information.

### Understanding Sexual Harassment
Sexual harassment subverts the mission of the University and threatens the well-being of students, faculty, and staff. All members of the UI community must uphold the UI mission and contribute to a safe environment that enhances learning. Incidents of sexual harassment must be reported immediately. For assistance, definitions, and the full University policy, see <https://osmrc.uiowa.edu/>.

### Reacting Safely to Severe Weather
In severe weather, class members should seek appropriate shelter immediately, leaving the classroom if necessary. The class will continue if possible when the event is over. For more information on Hawk Alert and the siren warning system, visit the [Department of Public Safety website](https://police.uiowa.edu/emergency-communications).

### Student Resources
I encourage interested students to make use of [the Writing Center](http://www.uiowa.edu/~writingc/) and [the Speaking Center](https://tippie.uiowa.edu/clas/scheduler/logon.aspx?).
