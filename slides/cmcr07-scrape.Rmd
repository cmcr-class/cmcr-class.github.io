Scraping and<br/> Managing Data
===

## Filenames

Take Jenny Bryan's advice to make sure your filenames:

0. are machine readable
    - and so are easy to search, filter, regex 

0. are human readable
    - and so are easy to figure out

0. play well with default ordering
    - put something numeric first

    - use the ISO 8601 standard for dates

    - left pad other numbers with zeros
    
>- BUT: leave the names of stuff you download alone

## Directory Structure

0. All files for a project should reside in a single directory (folder)

0. All project folders should be in a single directory, too (e.g., "projects")

0. This goes for everything else, btw
    - One for all teaching, with one folder for each class
        - prefixed with course number: "1400_intro-to-comparative"
        - with subdirs for each semester, slides, lectures, etc.

## Directory Structure

0. All files for a project should reside in a single directory (folder)

0. All project folders should be in a single directory, too (e.g., "projects")

0. This goes for everything else, btw
    - One for all reviewing
        - with a folder for each journal, and one for each ms 
        <p style="text-align:center"><img src="cmcr07_files/reviews.png" style="width: 600px;" align="center"/></p>

## Directory Structure

0. All files for a project should reside in a single directory (folder)

0. All project folders should be in a single directory, too (e.g., "projects")

0. This goes for everything else, btw
    - One for all service
        - with a folder for each committee
    
    - and so on . . .
